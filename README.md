# IEEE ENSIAS Management System

This is an acedemic project to practice the course we had in JEE, Servlets, JSP, JSTL, and more ...

The main goal of this web app is to manage and organize the work within the IEEE ENSIAS Student Branch. We have mainly 4 actors (admin who is the current president, chef (head) of cell, webmaster and a simple member). Each type of actor has a different dashboard and pages after login. Also, all the actors have commun features like the chatroom, editing personal information, visualizing list of events and their dedicated tasks, and more ...

## Main Interfaces :
